        Media queries are a feature in CSS that allow you to apply different styles based on various 
        characteristics of the user's device or viewport. They are commonly used to create responsive 
        web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, tablets, 
        and mobile phones.
    </p>
    <p>
        With media queries, you can specify certain conditions under which a set of CSS rules should be 
        applied. For example, you can target devices with a maximum screen width of 768 pixels and apply 
        specific styles to optimize the layout for smaller screens.

        Mobile First Approach: <br>
        The Mobile First Approach is a design philosophy where you first design and develop the website for 
        mobile devices, and then progressively enhance it for larger screens. This means you start with 
        the most essential styles for mobile and then use media queries to add more complex styles as the 
        screen size increases.
    </p>
    <p>Now, regarding the use of min-width or max-width in Mobile First Approach:</p>
    <p>
        * Mobile First Approach recommends using min-width: <br>
        In the Mobile First Approach, you start with the smallest screen size (typically for mobile devices) 
        and then use media queries with min-width to target larger screens and apply additional styles as the 
        screen size grows. This ensures that your base styles are designed for mobile devices, and then you 
        enhance the layout for larger screens. <br>
        Example:
    </p>
    <img src="./image-1.png" alt="image">
    <p>
        In this example, the padding for the .container element is set to 10 pixels for mobile devices, and a 
        media query is used with min-width: 768px to increase the padding to 20 pixels for larger screens.
    </p>

    <p>
        *Use of max-width can lead to complications in Mobile First Approach: <br>
         While you can technically use max-width in a Mobile First Approach, it might lead to more complex and 
         less maintainable styles. If you use max-width to apply styles for smaller screens, you might find 
         yourself overriding these styles with media queries later on, which could lead to redundant code. <br>
         Example:
    </p>
    <img src="./image-2.png" alt="image">
    <p>
        In this example, the base styles are designed for desktop, and a media query with max-width: 767px is 
        used to decrease the padding to 10 pixels for mobile devices. This approach could be more error-prone 
        and harder to maintain as you add more complex styles for larger screens.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, min-width is more helpful in the Mobile First Approach because it allows you to start with 
        essential styles for mobile and then progressively enhance the layout for larger screens. This 
        approach leads to more straightforward, efficient, and maintainable code as you apply additional 
        styles using media queries for larger devices.
